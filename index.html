        <h1>I love you SQL: A Poem</h1>
        <h3>By: Edmund Alyn Jones</h3>
        <p id="poem-layout">
            I love you SQL.<br />
            I want to build databases and grow little tables into big tables with you.<br />
            I love how you simplify the complicated things in my life.<br />
            You are so good at answering life’s big queries, <br />
            but you make sure I always ask correctly. <br /><br />
            They call it ‘syntax’,
            <br /><br />I call it poetry.<br /><br />
            I love how creative you let me get with formatting my code because you’re not afraid of
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <span>space</span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            At first, I didn’t quite get how we would “join” tables together, <br />
            but then I realized, <br /><br />
            it wasn’t you
            <br />
            <br />
            it was me.
            <br />
            I had to visualize the table on the left and the table on the right,
            <br />and suddenly, how the data was presented all made sense.
            <br />It was so much fun drawing a dB index on my whiteboard
            <br />while you just watched with that cute little cursor winking at me.
            <br />Thank you for being so patient SQL, even when I wasn’t patient with myself.
            <br />I look forward to establishing FOREIGN KEYS to sets of Big Data out in the wild.
            <br />I know you’ll be there when I am ready to create visualizations for my company using Tableau.
            <br />I can’t wait to learn more about you.
            <br />Your logic operators are sweet music to my fingertips.
            <br />They just seem to flow from my keyboard to you.
            <br />Now, I can’t even hear the words ‘structured’ or ‘procedure’ without thinking of you
            <br />and how you’ll take away all the mundane repetitive work out of my life with the creation of a single object.
            <br />I dream about you when I am not on my computer.
            <br />I stalk you on YouTube, to see what all the other people are saying about you.
            <br />We are meant to be together SQL.
            <br /><br />I can no longer imagine my tech life without you.
